#Where is it used?: This script is used in dataDrivenEstimation script.
#What is the purpose?: The main purpose of this is to correctly handle the non-prompt photon MC stat uncertainty in the photon_pt histogram. This script makes sure that the FR and kMC uncertainties are included in the photon_pt histograms
#What does it take?: It takes the photon_pt_eta and photon_pt_eta_sumw2 histograms and uses it to modify the sumw2 values stored in the photon_pt2_sumw2 histogram
#Future modifications: Potential places with pitfalls in the future are commented with "CAUTION" tag
