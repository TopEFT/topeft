def update_json(fname,dry_run=False,outname=None,verbose=False,**kwargs):
    '''
        Description:
            Attempts to open a json file, modify one or more of the outermost keys, and then save
            the new json. If dry_run is set to true, then skip writing to an output file. If outname
            is None then the file name will be set to the original and overwrite it.
        Arguments:
            fname -- The full file path to the json file that is to be updated/modified
            dry_run -- If true will do everything except actually write the resulting json to file
            outname -- If not None will write to a json file with this name
            verbose -- If true will include additional print outs about what is being updated
            **kwargs -- The key/value pairs to update in original json. The keys must already exist
                        in the original file or a KeyError will be raised
        Note:
            fname will in general will be the full file path to the desired file, so don't expect it
            to be saved in the same directory as the original w/o making sure the file path is correct
